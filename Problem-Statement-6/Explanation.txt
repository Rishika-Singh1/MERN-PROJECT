1. Predicted Output

undefined
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization


2. Explanation

(a) Why it prints undefined?
The variable 'a' is declared using var, which is hoisted to the top of the scope. Memory is allocated but the value is assigned later, so it prints undefined.

(b) Why does b throw an error?
The variable 'b' is declared using let. Although it is hoisted, it remains in the Temporal Dead Zone until initialization. Accessing it before initialization causes a ReferenceError.

(c) Why is c undefined inside the function?
The variable 'c' is declared using var inside the function. It is hoisted within the function scope but initialized later, so it prints undefined.


3. Line that causes the error

console.log(b);
